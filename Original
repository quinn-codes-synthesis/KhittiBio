<ul>
	<li>Khitti finds Alvina and asks her to make a proper bow for Meri. The two make plans to meet up once the bow is completed, with Meri joining the group so that they can all catch up on things.</li>
	<li>The aforementioned meeting takes place and does not go entirely well. It&#39;s tense, Khitti was drunk, and everyone was stressed.</li>
	<li>Khitti finds Encara in her room in Frostmaw&#39;s fort. She asks Encara to represent Delisha in the Paladin&#39;s Guild, but is met with a maybe. The two also speak of Venturil, Khitti&#39;s mindlink with Gabriel via the tainted blood from Aedrebyrg, and the likelihood that it&#39;s a mindflayer who is Gabriel&#39;s master. The decision is also made to summon Lionel and Valrae to Venturil, with the intent on putting them smackdab in the middle of a problem zone.</li>
	<li>After leaving Venturil, Khitti takes a pitstop at Meri&#39;s house before continuing on home to Cenril. There, Meri reveals the things she&#39;s hidden from her family, keeping good on her promise to Onyx: Onyx was Khitti&#39;s child from another time and place, where Facilier succeeded in kidnapping her, made her his bride, and Onyx the result of their pairing.</li>
	<li>On a nearly week long trip to Venturil, Encara, Khitti and Meri track down some wraiths that Encara&#39;s been hunting for some time and are met with the warning &#39;soon&#39; before their demise.&nbsp;Days later, the three hunters are joined by Zahrani and the four head to Aedrebyrg. Things are worse than they&#39;d hoped and only worsen during the duration of their mission, especially when Khitti is forced to drink the tainted blood that plagued the denizens of the village and the sealife nearby.</li>
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia, serif;">Encara happens upon Khitti in Lionel&rsquo;s office. The two have a surprising heart-to-heart talk about Khitti&rsquo;s hesitation to take up Diamond Dust again, because it reminded her of Onyx. Encara does her best to knock some sense into the redhead and asks her to assist her in a mission of her own on the way to Venturil, to deal with wraiths from Encara&rsquo;s recent past.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia, serif;">Khitti meets once more with Zahrani by chance, officially enlisting the feline for the stealth mission to Aedrebyrg.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia, serif;">The meeting Khitti&rsquo;s been working towards for some time now finally happens and the Paladin&rsquo;s Guild is reborn, set on restoring hope and peace in Lithrydel.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia, serif;">Khitti and Meri are approached by Encara. The three plot out a stealth mission to Aedrebyrg and Meri asks Khitti and Encara to teach her how to be a ranger.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia, serif;">The mermaid, Nemona--the very same that saved Khitti just after her rebirth and whom Khitti stole a few scales from for her vampirism cure--seeks out Khitti in what seemed like her final moments before Khitti used Seika&rsquo;s magic to heal her, and tells the templar of the plague that&rsquo;s befallen Aedrebyrg in Venturil, and perhaps other places in that region as well.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia, serif;">Khitti finally gives birth to Dominic Connor, the very same child from the shared visions Khitti and Brand had together. Facilier shows up in an attempt to steal the child and Khitti back to the Shadow Plane. He failed,&nbsp;was slain and Khitti&rsquo;s curse removed, thanks to Onyx&#39;s selfless efforts, though Onyx&#39;s life was also sacrificed and the undead was taken away from those that had come to care about them.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia, serif;">Khitti surprises Brand with the newly painted baby&#39;s room, tickets to bear wrestling, and a weekend alone after their child is born.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia, serif;">Khitti, Brand, Meri, Zahrani, Rorin, members of the Warrior&#39;s Guild, and the crew of the Tranquility head out to an island off the coast of Chartsend for a recon mission. Things, as usual, do not go as planned an a new evil is found out.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia, serif;">Meri surprises Khitti by setting up the baby&#39;s room to be painted and the two pool their artistic resources together to give the room an under the sea theme, complete with a redheaded, green-eyed mermaid and a blonde, green-eyed ship captain!</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia, serif;">Going on a bad feeling in her gut, Khitti heads towards the Nameless Desert to find Lionel and the party that was headed to the Shadow Plane. She was too late, but managed to be there for when they got back. Lionel was raving about Valrae again; Khitti was not happy.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia, serif;">Celaeno returns to the Tranquility for food and training, and ends up telling Khitti about the lesions forming in her body thanks to her magic usage. More and more Khitti sees herself in Celaeno, and even more now she&#39;s determined to protect her and teach her to fight.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia, serif;">Meri finds Khitti at Khitti&#39;s bakery. The two catch up and Meri tells Khitti of Valrae&#39;s warning regarding the crystal skulls--one of which is in Lionel&#39;s possession.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia, serif;">Khitti and Kelovath finally cross paths. The paladin of Arkhen catches up with Seika and Khitti let&#39;s Kelovath in on her plans to bring other devout followers of the good and neutral gods together.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia, serif;">Khitti attends a ritual performed by Leone and Hildegarde in an attempt to summon Aramoth and things, in Khitti&#39;s opinion, goes drastically wrong.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia, serif;">Celaeno takes a trip to the Tranquility and Khitti promises to teach her the Black Tides.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia, serif;">Zahrani finds Khitti within Cyris&#39; chapel speaking to Seika. Khitti announced her want to start her path to become a follower of Cyris and broached the idea of bringing Lithrydel&#39;s paladins together.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia, serif;">Khitti and Brand go on their pilgrimage to Larket&#39;s chapel of Cyris. Facilier once again attempts to steal their child, but his army is fought off by the couple, with some help from Seika&#39;s magic.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia, serif;">Another meeting is held by Lionel and Leone. Things continue to not go according to plan. Doubts and worries that had once plagued Khitti have returned again, though Seika, the holy sprite inside Tenbatsu Kaji, attempts to soothe her.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia, serif;">Khitti, Brand, and Lionel meet on the Tranquility to discuss things on all fronts. Dozla, Brand&#39;s first mate, suggests that Khitti and Brand go on a pilgrimage to Cyris&#39; chapel in Larket.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia, serif;">Meri returns from the Shadow Plane.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia, serif;">During a spar between herself and Brand, Khitti comes to find that her magic has been taken away from her by Facilier, likely in retaliation. It&rsquo;s also realized that the sword and Khitti can now speak to one another, no longer barred by Khitti's necromantic abilities. Khitti also asked if Brand could be given the ability to hear the sword, in case of emergencies. He was and didn&rsquo;t like it. The first major KhittiBrand argument since her rebirth ensued.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia, serif;">Khitti and Brand attend the Shishi vs Eirik fight in the Redskull Trophy Ring. The prize for the fight was the fabled Tenbatsu Kaji, the blade of Cyris. Neither contender went home with it. Instead, it chose Khitti. Being a necromancer, Khitti is unable to wield the sword, or even be around it, without it sapping her strength and magic. As per usual, Brand and Lionel are skeptical.</span></li>
	<li><span style="font-family:georgia, serif;">(Timeline has been shortened and will continue to be as time progresses because ain't nobody got time for that.) </span></li>
