<!--body SEEMS to be the most "default" CSS for everything? Created a couple of early classes just to have something to add on to. This html is enough of a mess that I'm probably going to have to strip it all just so I can read what I'm doing and refer to the original document as needed, but I didn't have the time to dig in much futher than that. Style tags would normally go around the below, if I wasn't going to be copy/pasting from jsfiddle.-->

body {
  background-color: #000;
  color: #568203;
  text-align: center;
  font-family: georgia, serif;
  font-size: 14px;
}

.music-notes-etc {
  color: #eeff08;
}

.purple-red {
  color: #603;
}

<!--the below was just some fooling around with trying to reduce the amount of tags. It wasn't long before I realized me trying to go line by line creating classes and ids and etc as I went was... not going to go as easily as I was hoping it would.-->

<style>
:root {
  --yg: #eeff08;
  --pr: #660033;
}
  
body {
  background-color: #000000;
  color: #568203;
  font-family: Georgia, Serif;
  font-size: 16px;
  text-align: center;
}

.yellow-text {
  color: var(--yg);
  font-size: 14px;
  font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;
}

#lyrics {
  font-size: 14px;
  font-style: italic;
  color: var(--pr);
}
</style>
